# Practicing manipulating data in Python using Reticulate

I have previously used Python where absoluetly necessary for scraping pdf data. It has been a few years since I was using Python during the Covid-19 pandemic and shortly after. Now I want to check my current system's setup and get Python working again as I anticipate some problems.

I have Python installed on this machine but this is all I know for now. Let's see what works...

```{python}
import numpy as np
```

Importing numpy worked without issue. I got my Python version which is currently 3.9.4. I didn't have to do a pip (or other) install. Let's move on.

```{python}
a = np.array([1,2,3])
print(a)
```

Initializing and printing an array worked OK. I'm working through [a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI) on numpy and will try a few more functions to check that that things are working OK.

```{python}
a.ndim
a.shape
a.dtype

# Get size in bytes
a.itemsize
a.size
a.nbytes
```

Here are some useful commands:

```{python}
# Get a specific row
# a[0, :]
# Or column
# a[:, 1]
# Note that python is zero-indexed
# Also note that the ":" really represents "FIRST:LAST" so you can get ranges
# You can also do [startindex;endindex;stepsize]
# You can assign like this
# a[1,5] = 5
```

Initializing different types of arrays

```{python}
np.zeros((2,3))
np.ones((4,2,2))
# shape then value:
np.full((2,2), 99)
np.identity(5)
```

Remember that b = a in python just points b to a without really making a copy. To actually make a copy you should assign by "b = a.copy()"

Other useful functions are thinks like:

n.pmin()
np.max()
you can use the axis argument in these commands to summarise certain rows or columns.
